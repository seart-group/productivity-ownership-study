This folder contains everything needed to set up the server and replicate experiments. 

Specifically:
- the `generate_questions` and `proxy_server` folders contain the files and scripts to automatically generate questions based on user-written code;
- the `main-environment` folder contains the entire server setup.
  
Please, refer to the `main-environment/README.md` file for further instructions.
